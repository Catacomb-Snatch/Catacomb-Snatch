# Change log

## [0.1.1-preview] - 2019-08-06

### Fixes

* `NativeHashMap.Remove(TKey key, TValueEQ value)` is now supported in bursted code.
* Adding deprecated `NativeList.ToDeferredJobArray()` back in - Use `AsDeferredJobArray()`
  instead. The deprecated function will be removed in 3 months. This can not be auto-upgraded
  prior to Unity `2019.3`.
* Fixing bug where `TryDequeue` on an empty `NativeQueue` that previously had enqueued elements could leave it in
  an invalid state where `Enqueue` would fail silently afterwards.

### Changes

* Updated dependencies for this package.
