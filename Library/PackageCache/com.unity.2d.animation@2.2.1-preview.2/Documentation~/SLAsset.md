## Sprite Library Asset

Use the __Sprite Library Asset__ to build a collection of Sprites grouped by __Category__. This allows you to create groups of similar Sprites. For example, you might create a Category called __Weapon__, and then add Sprites with the Labels ‘Saber’, ‘Bat’, ‘Blade’, and ‘Axe’. 

To create a __Sprite Library Asset__, go to __Assets__ > __Create__ > __Sprite Library Asset__.
