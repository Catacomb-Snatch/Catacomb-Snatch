# Introduction to 2D Animation

This documentation aims to guide you on the steps needed to quickly rig and animate a 2D character in Unity with the 2D Animation V2 package and tools. This package is only supported for Unity 2019.2 and above.

## Adobe Photoshop PSB format

For character animation with the __2D Animation package__, the [PSD Importer package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.psdimporter@latest/index.html?preview=1) is required. The  PSD Importer package currently only supports the __Adobe Photoshop PSB format__, and does not support the Adobe PSD format. The PSB format has identical functions as PSD, with the additional support for much larger image sizes.
