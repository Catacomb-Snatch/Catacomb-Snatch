# Editor Integration

The __Skinning Editor__ has two columns in its __Sprite Visibility__ panel, which allow you to specify a __Category__ and __Label__ for a selected Sprite. The __Category__ and __Label__ belong to the __Sprite Library Asset__ of the imported PSB file.

To set a Category for a Sprite:

1. To assign the Sprite to a new Category, navigate to its row in the __Category__ column, open the drop-down menu, and select __New__.

2. Enter a name for the Category. Different Category names within the same Library Asset must be unique.

3. When you enter a Category name, Unity automatically assigns that Sprite a __Label__ based on the Spriteâ€™s name. You can change this Label if you want to. Label names must be unique within their Category.

4. To assign the Sprite to an existing __Category__, navigate to its row in the __Category__ column, open the drop-down menu, and select a Category from the list.
