# Sprite Swap and 2D Animation Integration

__Sprite Swap__ is integrated with the 2D Animation workflow. You must install the following packages or newer to use Sprite Swap:

- [2D Animation version 2.2.0-preview.1](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.animation@latest/index.html?preview=1)
- [PSDImporter version 1.2.0-preview.1](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.psdimporter@latest/index.html?preview=1)

To ensure Sprite Swap works correctly with skeletal animation, the animation rig needs to be identical between the interchangeable Sprites. You can use the __Copy and Paste__ feature to duplicate the rig from one Sprite to the other Sprite(s) to ensure they can be swapped.
