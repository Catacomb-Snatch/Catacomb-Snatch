      or with a friend, and hopefuly up to 4 people at once! The goal is to find the
      treasure, and be the first to get the most. You do have obsticals, including
      monsters that roam the anchient ruins you are exploring, breakable walls, traps,
      and of course, the other players.

  - heading: Why does this exist?
    text: This game was made by Mojang, and then updated by a guy on GitHub named
      Maescool and was updated reguaraly up untill 2014. I liked it back then, and
      I like it now, so I'm fixing it up.

  - heading: Why are you using Unity?
    text: As far as I know, the original project was supposed to span several platofrms
      including iOS, tvOS, Andorid, and others. The original code was completly in
      Java, and didn't have an engine associated with it (engine as in Unreal Editor
      or Unity). The GitHub team tried to use libGDX, but it lost iOS support and
      most packages that were used in the original code were out dated and not updated
      for a long time. Also, with the whole thing of Oracle cracking down on Java
      Runtime Enviroment stuff, Unity made sense to me.

  - heading: Credits
    text: First off, the original game was made by Mojang AB during a make a game
      in a week chellenge, or soemthing to that end. It was originaly released in
      a Humble Bundle and then the source code was released to the world. We don't
      know what the licensing is for the assests. Because of that, we are not looking
      to use this game to make money, and it will stay as an opensource project. Use
      of these sprites and resources out side of Catacomb Snatch may not be permited.
      Use at your own risk.
    linkText: Mojang doesn't have a dedicated website anymore, so I'll just put Minecraft's

    text: For the code, I started out using Sebastain League's tutorial 'Create a
      Game (Unity 5)', but Mr. League's was mainly for Unity 3D. The main resources
      I use now are Unity's Roguelike tutorial and the YouTuber Brakeys' tutorials
      for 2D Unity
