**THIS IS NOT PLAYABLE**

The roadmap for what I'm doing!

- ☐ Full conversion to Unity
    - ☑️ Character can move
    - ☐ AI routing and scripts for moving mobs (Close)
    - ☑️ Making the walls act like... walls
    - ☐ Tile randomazation
    - ☐ Making Rails connect to each other
    - ☐ Gun mechanics (Following your mouse, bouncy bullets, auto aim for phone users)
    - ☐ Manual keybindings/Controller support
    
  ☐ Texture thingies aren't done
     - ☐ Animations for other characters, mainly need to make idle ones for them
    
If you would like to help with this, download this repo, unzip it, and open the Unity Hub. Press add, and locate where you unzipped the repo. 

If you are using Windows (Visual Studio), you'll need to go to Edit > Prefrences > External Tools > External Script Editor (It's the first one on the 'External Tools' page). Select 'Visual Studio (Whatever edition you have)', and now you are done with setup with Unity.

If you are using Mac, I think you'll be using MonoDevelop. The process is the same as Windows, just it will have MonoDevelop in External Script Editor

Tiled was used in the original Java game, and we are using it in this. You can download it at https://www.mapeditor.org/ SuperTiled2Unity sbould automaticaly install, but if it doesn't here you go: 
https://seanba.itch.io/supertiled2unity

Unity version used: 2019.4.x (Move up to that to see if something is fixed) Will update to 2020 when it's out of beta, and then again to the LTS version of 2020

~~I want to use 2D Pixel Perfect in this project to scale sprites depending on what device you use. It needs 2D IK, I think, but both Packages get installed automaticaly, and they are in the Package Manager if something goes wrong.~~ It's still installed, but I have no plans to use it yet.
